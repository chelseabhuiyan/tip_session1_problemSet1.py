# PROBLEM 1
#Understand :
#Given the fucntion, print_list() with paramenter lst. 
#We need to complete the fucntion so that it prints out all the elements in the list.

#1. Should the function use a for loop or a while loop to iterate through the list elements?
#2. What should the function do if the list is empty?

#Match : This problem iterates over elements in a list and performing an operation on each element. 

#Plan :
# Define fucntion with lst as parameter (given)
#use a for loop to iterate over the elements in the list
#inside for loop, print each element
#Test cases: (given)
#lst = ["squirtle", "gengar", "charizard", "pikachu"]

#Implementation: 
def print_list(lst):
  for i in lst:
    print (i)

lst = ["squirtle", "gengar", "charizard", "pikachu"]
print_list(lst)

# PROBLEM 2
#Understand:
#1. How do you iterate through the list?
#2. What do you do with each element?

#Match: Similar to problem 1, we are iterating over elements in a list and performing an operation on each element. 
#Here we are multiplying by 2

#Plan:
#1.Define fucntion with parameter lst (given)
#2. for each element in lst 
#3. inside for loop, print each element multiplied by 2 

#Implementation: 
def doubled(lst):
  for i in lst:
    print (2*i)

lst =[1,2,3]
doubled(lst)

#Problem 3: 
def doubled(lst):
  doubled_list = []  #initialize a new empty list
  for i in lst:
    doubled_list.append (2*i) #loop through each item in orignal list and double it and add it to the new list
  return doubled_list

lst = [1,2,3]
new_lst = doubled(lst)
print(new_lst)

#Problem 4: 
def flip_sign(lst):
  return [-x for x in lst]

lst = [1,-2,-3,4]
flipped_lst = flip_sign(lst)
print(flipped_lst)

#Problem 5:
def max_difference(lst):
